### Hi there 👋

My goal is to deliver your project in the best quality.

My specialties are:
✔️ Modern Website Development: from scratch, revamp, update, customize, and other forms.
✔️ Application architecture: Microservice or Monolithic.
✔️ Integration of API and services.
✔️ Database organization.
✔️ Production delivery with CI/CD.

I use professional knowledge of the latest versions of PHP, JavaScript(es6+), Node.js, Typescript, Python, C#, Go, Elixir, to achieve results. Vue.js or React.js for front-end. GIT version control system (Github & GitLab & Bitbucket).

I use such solutions in my work:

Back-end: PHP (Laravel, Yii, Symfony), Node.js (Express.js, Loopback 4), Python (Django), Api gateway (Express gateway, KONG).

As a result of our cooperation, you will receive:
✔️ Quality.
